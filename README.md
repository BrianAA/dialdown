# WIP Dialdown
Dialdown is a dialogue system for unity3d. It uses a text file in a markdown style formatting and processes that markdown into a dialogue with questions, options, nested dialogue, variables, and more. It can be extended to suite your dialogue needs and tries unopinionated on how it is implemented ui. The text file is dependant highly on formatting, but very easy to learn. 

## Update
I have made significant improvements to dialdown but its not currently ready to be used. Hoping to have a release of this working in the coming weeks.
